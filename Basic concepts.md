## Crafting Levels with Kobra Game HTML

### Traditional Game Levels: A Primer
In classic video games, levels progress players through a sequence of challenges, each with its own objective. Completion rewards players with insights into gameplay mechanics and bonuses, enhancing their skills.

Drawing inspiration from this, `Kobra Game HTML` introduces web design as a game-like journey.
