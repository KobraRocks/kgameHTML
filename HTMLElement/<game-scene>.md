#### Description:
The `<game-scene>` is a custom container element specifically designed to hold game levels represented by the `<game-level>` tag. This element helps manage and represent different game scenes and provides a way to record navigation history and direction for a better game experience.

#### Attributes:

1. `history`:
    - **Type**: String (comma-separated URLs)
    - **Description**: Holds a record of navigation history, listing URLs within the same domain that the user has visited.
    - **Default Value**: Empty string

2. `direction`:
    - **Type**: Enumeration (`vertical` | `horizontal`)
    - **Description**: Indicates how the user should navigate through the game scene. This directionality provides information on whether the game levels inside the scene are stacked vertically (`vertical`) or laid out side by side (`horizontal`).
    - **Default Value**: `horizontal`

#### Content Model:

- The `<game-scene>` contains only `<game-level>` elements, representing an individual game level.

#### Example Usage:

```html
<game-scene history="/level1, /level2" direction="vertical">
    <game-level id="level2" type="story" mode="slideshow" axis="vertical">...</game-level>
    ...
</game-scene>
```

#### Styling with CSS:

Users can style the `<game-scene>` and its contents using standard CSS selectors. For instance:

```css
game-scene[direction="horizontal"] {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
}

game-scene[direction="vertical"] {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}
```

#### Interaction with JavaScript:

JavaScript can interact with the `<game-scene>` to read or update attributes, manage the content, or handle events.

```javascript
let gameScene = document.querySelector('game-scene');
console.log(gameScene.getAttribute('history')); // logs navigation history
```

This is a basic spec, and depending on the exact requirements and complexity of the project, it might be necessary to expand on this, including adding events, methods, or other behaviors.
